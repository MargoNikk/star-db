# Star Wars DB

This is a learning project. StarDB is a simple database of the Star Wars universe. You can see characters, planets and ships and brief information about them. The login page has also been implemented, and for logged in users, an accessible page of the Jedi Temple. Also under the header you can see a banner with random information on the planets, which changes after a certain period of time

For an additional opportunity, as part of the training, additional functionality was implemented that allows you to change the real server to a mock one.

The project was implemented using React, HOC, React Context, React Router, React prop types and default props.
